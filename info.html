            <p class="para">This is a small community where we spread awareness world wide regarding the 
                vanishing of the natural resources and how to minimize the use of non renewable resources, 
                through online posters and by conducting meeting every weekends to stay in touch with the people to keep updated 
                on the current issues and in a way try and make this world worth living.Natural resources are not luxury 
                but a necessity of the Human Race. Our objective is to conserve natural resources and the existing 
                natural environment and where possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.Environmental protection is improving,
                 defending, and maintaining the quality of the environment. The main methods of environmental protection are recycling, 
                 reusing, and reducing; however, some other methods such as Green Energy production, green transportation development, 
                 and eco-friendly industrialization also exist. Not only residents but we also encourage businesses and industries 
                 to play their basic roles to improve the environment.Ecosystems are the foundation of life on Earth, 
                 and they provide many benefits to humans, such as clean air and water, food, and fiber.it is imperative to protect 
                 our natural environment from deteriorating, and the only way to do that is through environmental protection. 
                 This process should be adopted by every country as soon as possible before it is too late. The objective of this organization
                  is to conserve all the natural resources and try to repair some parts of the environment that are possible to get repaired.
                   The biophysical environment is getting degraded permanently because of overconsumption, population growth, and the rapid
                 development of technology. This can be stopped if the government plan strategies to restrict these activities to perform in a 
                 controlled way. This environmental protection essay can be a great help for the students to understand the environment they
                  are living in. we conduct a few activitiesevery weekends to the working sectors and everyday activities
                  for the senior citizens and school going children.<br> </p>
